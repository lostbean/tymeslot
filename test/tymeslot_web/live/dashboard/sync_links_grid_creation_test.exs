defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.SyncLinksGridCreationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Creating a link by ticking a cell of the grid, and the things the grid must
  refuse to create.

  These were written against the "Add a link" form the panel used to carry.
  That form is gone — the grid creates links now — but what it was guarding is
  unchanged: a save must reach no provider, a read-only subscription must never
  become a target however its id arrives, and a refusal must be readable by an
  organiser who does not read English.

  Kept apart from `SyncLinksSettingsTest` because that module is already at the
  line limit the analyser enforces, and apart from `SyncLinksMatrixTest`
  because that one covers what the grid *draws* rather than what a save through
  it may and may not write.
