defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.EngineEtagBaselineTest do
  @moduledoc """
  That a write's own etag becomes the mirror's baseline, and that the three
  etag-based conflict kinds fire from it.

  `EngineConflictTest` covers the classification, but every mirror row in it is
  hand-inserted with a `target_etag` already in place. That is what let those
  three kinds pass a green suite for as long as they were dead in production:
  the engine wrote `nil` into that column on every real write, so nothing ever
  had a baseline to compare against and the classifier was never reached.

  So the rule these tests hold is the one that suite cannot: the baseline has to
  come *from the write*, through the engine, with no test fixture standing in
  for it. Each of them mirrors first and asserts on the row the engine left,
  rather than on a row it was handed.

  The absent-etag cases are the regression guard that matters most. A provider
  reporting no etag must record `nil` and produce no conflict of any kind — a
  false row is worse than an empty log, because the log is read precisely when
  somebody is trying to find out why a calendar looks wrong.
