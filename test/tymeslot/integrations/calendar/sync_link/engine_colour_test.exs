defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.EngineColourTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Painting a link's `mirror_colour` onto the placeholder it writes.

  The colour is a second provider call, not a field on the mirror write, and
  both halves of that decision are pinned here.

  The first is that only Google can receive it. `patch_event_colour/4` lives on
  `Google.GoogleCalendarApi` alone and is not part of the shared `Provider`
  behaviour, so there is no polymorphic call to make; every other target has to
  decline by name rather than by attempting a request that cannot work. The
  Outlook case asserts that the hard way, by setting no expectation for the
  patch at all — `verify_on_exit!` fails the test if the engine reaches for a
  colour endpoint that does not exist.

  The second is that a failed patch must not fail the mirror. By the time the
  colour is applied the placeholder is already on the target blocking the time
  it exists to block; propagating the error would have Oban retry the whole
  mirror and re-send that placeholder to fix nothing but a hue. The test that
  earns its keep here is the one where the patch returns an error and
  `mirror/3` still answers `:ok` with an `active` mapping.
