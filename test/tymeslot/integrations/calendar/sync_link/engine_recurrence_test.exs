defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.EngineRecurrenceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A recurring source becomes one recurring placeholder, or none at all.

  The assertions that earn their keep are the ones on the *payload handed to the
  provider*, not on the stored mirror row. A mirror row proves only that
  Tymeslot recorded a write; it says nothing about whether the RRULE reached the
  target, and a version that stored the row correctly while sending a payload
  with no `recurrence_rule` would write a single busy block at the last
  occurrence's date and pass a row-only test. That is precisely the failure this
  stage exists to remove, so the payload is what gets asserted.

  The request-count test is the second: one master fetch per series per change.
  A version that fetched per occurrence would be correct and unaffordable, and
  nothing but counting the calls tells the two apart.

  The EXDATE tests are the third, and are on the payload for the same reason. A
  cancelled occurrence is freed by the `EXDATE` line reaching the target, not by
  anything Tymeslot stores: a version that resolved the exceptions correctly and
  dropped them on the way into the payload would leave the cancelled Tuesday
  blocked and pass every row-level assertion.
