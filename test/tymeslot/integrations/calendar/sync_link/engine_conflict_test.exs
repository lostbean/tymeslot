defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.EngineConflictTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What the engine records when the two sides of a mirror disagree.

  The audit is the whole point: a placeholder that moves, reverts, or vanishes
  without explanation is indistinguishable from a bug, and the organiser has no
  other way to find out which it was. So every non-trivial resolution has to
  leave a row.

  "Exactly one row" is asserted everywhere rather than "at least one". A
  divergence logged twice — once by the branch that detected it and once by the
  branch that resolved it — reads as two separate incidents in a history whose
  only value is that it is a faithful sequence, and the two are indistinguishable
  after the fact.
