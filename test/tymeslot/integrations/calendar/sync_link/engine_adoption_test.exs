  @moduledoc """
  The 409 create→update fallback, and the identifier it records.

  Google reserves a deleted event's id, so a placeholder that was withdrawn
  leaves a tombstone and recreating it under the same deterministic id answers
  409 forever. The recovery is to update the id that already exists — but the
  update has to record the identifier the *provider* filed the event under, and
  the two provider families disagree about what that is.

  Getting it wrong is not cosmetic, and both consequences were live: 49 mapping
  rows recorded our internal uid where Google holds a hash of it, which left
  loop prevention unable to recognise the placeholder (so a real event grew a
  fresh "Busy" block on every sweep) and teardown unable to delete it.
