defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.DisplayHelpersTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `integration_label/1`, the disambiguator for two integrations of one
  provider.

  The case that motivates it: connecting two Google accounts stores the same
  literal name for both, because `google_oauth_helper.ex` hardcodes
  `"Google Calendar"` and nothing downstream ever revisits it. The account
  those rows differ in is already stored; only the label ignored it.

  These tests pin the fallback order rather than any one provider, because the
  disambiguating column differs per family: OAuth has an email, the CalDAV
  family has `base_url||username`, and an ICS subscription has only a feed
  origin — its `provider_account_id` is a SHA-256 digest and would be noise.
