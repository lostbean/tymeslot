defmodule Tymeslot.Availability.MirrorBlocksAvailabilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A busy-block mirror in the event cache still removes a slot from availability.

  **This test pins existing behaviour; it does not describe a change.**
  `CalendarEvent.blocking?/1` returns true for any confirmed, opaque event and
  never consults `created_by_tymeslot`, so a mirror blocks with no code written
  for it. That is deliberate: availability is computed across all of an
  organiser's calendars together, and a mirror occupying time on the second
  calendar is a true statement about that calendar. Booking over it would
  double-book the very time the mirror exists to protect.

  The pin is here because the grid hides mirrors, which makes them easy to read
  as "not real events". A later change that carried that intuition into the
  availability path — skipping mirrors alongside hiding them, or filtering them
  in the cache read for speed — would silently reopen every mirrored slot for
  booking, and nothing else in the suite would notice. Deleting or weakening a
  test here is the change; make it deliberately.

  Asserted against `Calculate.available_slots/6` fed from the real cache read
  (`CalendarEventQueries.in_range/2`) rather than a hand-built event list: the
  claim being pinned is that a mirror row written to the cache reaches the slot
  calculation, so the cache read has to be part of the test.
