defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SyncLinkWriteBackWorkerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  One mirror write, dispatched.

  The discards are what this module is mostly about. Every one of them is a
  condition under which no number of retries could ever succeed — a read-only
  target, a paused link, a link that has been deleted — and a job that keeps
  retrying against one of those burns provider quota until Oban gives up, on
  every event of every sync.

  The read-only case matters most and is asserted the hard way, by setting no
  provider expectation at all: `verify_on_exit!` turns any call into a failure,
  so the test fails if the worker so much as reaches for the provider before
  discarding. The changeset already refuses an ICS target at configuration time;
  this is the guard for the link created before a reconnect turned its target
  into a subscription.
