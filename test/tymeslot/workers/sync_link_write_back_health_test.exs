defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SyncLinkWriteBackHealthTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A target calendar that will not accept mirror writes becomes visibly
  unhealthy.

  Without this the failure is silent in the only place it matters. Mirror
  write-backs are best-effort by construction — a failed write never fails the
  inbound sync that triggered it, and the reconcile sweep quietly retries — so
  an organiser whose target calendar has had its token revoked sees exactly
  what they saw when it worked: nothing. The busy blocks simply stop appearing,
  and the first they learn of it is a double booking.

  Surfacing goes through the health-check domain that already exists and is
  already integration-keyed, so the hub badge lights up with no second store
  and no second breaker. `HealthCheck.attention_status/2` is the ladder the
  dashboard reads, and it is asserted here rather than only the stored row:
  writing a row nothing renders is how the first version of a feature like this
  ships broken.

  Only an *exhausted* job marks the integration. A single failed attempt is a
  timeout or a rate limit, and Oban's whole retry ladder exists because those
  recover on their own; marking on the first one would put the badge up for
  every transient blip on every event.
