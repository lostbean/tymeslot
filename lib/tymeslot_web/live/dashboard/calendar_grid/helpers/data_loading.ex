  Assigns the set of cached events that are busy-block mirrors of an event on
  another of the organiser's calendars.

  A mirror exists for external tools reading the target calendar; drawing it in
  the organiser's own grid would double-draw every synchronised event beside its
  source, which is noise rather than information.

  Called from `load_events/1` rather than only from `load_integrations/1`, and
  the coupling is the point: this set is a filter over the events that call
  just fetched, so anything that reloads the events without reloading it hands
  the filter a stale answer. That is not hypothetical — "Refresh calendars"
  reloads events alone, which is precisely when a sync has just written the
  placeholders the set is meant to know about, and the organiser watched their
  own mirrors appear beside their sources.

  Not moved into `precompute_derived/1`, which is the other candidate home:
  that runs on every inline edit, every drag, and every live cache update, none
  of which change the mirror set, and each would gain a database round trip.
  `load_events/1` is already going to the database for the events themselves,
  so this rides alongside as one further indexed lookup on
  `calendar_sync_mirrors_target_uid_index`.

  The set is keyed on `{integration_id, uid}` from the mirrors table, never on
  `created_by_tymeslot`. That flag means "Tymeslot wrote this", which is equally
  true of an event a booking created, so filtering on it would hide the
  organiser's own bookings.

  # over separate stores, so both are consulted rather than one deriving the
  # other: hiding an account must not erase the per-calendar choices underneath
  # it, which the organiser gets back when they show the account again. The
  # third is not a control at all — a mirror is never shown.
