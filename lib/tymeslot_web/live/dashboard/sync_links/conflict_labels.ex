defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.SyncLinks.ConflictLabels do
  @moduledoc """
  The organiser-facing wording for a recorded mirror divergence.

  `calendar_sync_conflicts` stores a `kind` and a `resolution` as short codes
  the engine writes — `"mirror_edited"`, `"deletion_won"`. Those are precise
  and meaningless to anyone who has not read the engine, so every one is
  translated into a sentence describing what happened to the organiser's
  calendar rather than what the engine called it.

  Lifted out of `SyncLinksSettingsComponent` because it is a translation table
  and nothing else: no socket, no assigns, no state. Leaving it inline pushed
  that module past the line budget the analyser enforces, and the seam is a
  real one — the panel decides *when* to show a conflict, this decides what it
  says.

  Every clause has a catch-all, deliberately. A kind or resolution added to the
  engine and not yet added here renders a vaguer sentence rather than crashing
  the panel that was showing it.
