defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SyncLinkWriteBackWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Performs one mirror write: the placeholder for a single source event, on a
  single link's target.

  One job per `{link, source event}` rather than one per sync batch. A batch job
  would retry the whole batch when one event's write failed, re-sending every
  other placeholder in it, and would collapse a hundred independent failures
  into one opaque error. Per-event jobs also give `unique` something to key on,
  which is what makes rapid edits collapse instead of racing.

  ## The when, not the what

  Everything this worker decides is about dispatch: which jobs may run, which
  are hopeless, and what an outcome means to Oban.
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.Engine` owns the write itself and its
  bookkeeping, and its `:ok | {:error, term()} | {:discard, term()}` contract is
  passed straight through.

  ## Discards, and why each is not a retry

  A discard is the right answer only when no number of attempts could succeed.
  Each of these qualifies:

  - `:link_not_found` — the organiser deleted the link after the job was
    enqueued. There is no target to write to.
  - `:link_disabled` — the link is paused. Pausing deliberately leaves existing
    placeholders alone, so there is nothing to do and nothing to undo.
  - `:target_is_read_only` — a subscription feed. `create_event` returns
    `{:error, :read_only}` for these *always*. The changeset already refuses
    such a target at configuration time; this catches the link configured
    before its target was reconnected as a subscription. It is matched on the
    function head, ahead of every other consideration, so a hopeless write
    never reaches the provider at all.
  - `:source_not_cached` — the source event is gone from the cache and there is
    no mapping to withdraw either. Nothing to mirror and nothing to clean up.
  - `:not_an_eligible_source` — the event fails `Eligibility.mirror_source?/3`:
    it is itself a mirror, transparent, cancelled, or a recurring series on a
    link whose target cannot expand one. The one nuance is that an event which
    *became* ineligible after having been mirrored is not a discard — its
    placeholder is withdrawn first, because a source that has turned
    transparent or been cancelled must stop blocking time on the target.

  ## Why a recurring source on an unsupported target takes that same route

  Since `Eligibility.worth_enqueueing?/2` stopped refusing recurrence, a
  recurring event on a calendar with three links is enqueued for all three, and
  the ones whose targets cannot expand a series arrive here to be turned away.
  They are routed through `unmirror_or_discard/4` rather than discarded
  outright, and the difference is not academic.

  A discard is right only when nothing needs undoing, and here something can:
  the same source may already carry a placeholder on that very target, written
  while it was still a single event and now describing an occurrence that no
  longer stands alone. Discarding would leave that block sitting on the
  organiser's calendar until the reconcile sweep happened to look. Asking the
  mapping table first costs one indexed lookup, withdraws the stale placeholder
  when there is one, and discards as `:not_an_eligible_source` when there is
  not — which is the ordinary case and still terminal, because no number of
  retries will make an Outlook target expand an RRULE.

  The route is the one a cancelled event already takes, and deliberately so:
  "this source may no longer have a placeholder here" is one question, and
  answering it in one place is what keeps the two answers from drifting.

  Everything else — a rate limit, an expired token, a timeout — is an
  `{:error, reason}` that Oban retries with backoff.

  ## Why the last failed attempt marks the target unhealthy

  A mirror write is best-effort by construction: it never fails the inbound
  sync that triggered it, and the reconcile sweep retries quietly. That is the
  right design and it has one consequence — a target calendar that refuses
  every write is completely silent to the organiser. The busy blocks simply
  stop appearing, and the first they hear of it is a double booking.

  The scheduled health probe cannot catch it either, because the probe is a
  *read*. An integration whose token was granted read-only, or whose calendar
  was made read-only downstream, passes every probe and fails every write. So a
  failure only the write path can observe is reported by the write path, into
  the health-check domain that already exists and already drives the hub badge
  — no second store, and no second breaker on top of
  `CalendarCircuitBreaker`.

  Only the *final* attempt marks. Everything before it is a blip that Oban's
  retry ladder exists to absorb, and marking on the first one would raise the
  badge for every timeout on every event.

  ## Eligibility is re-checked here

  The enqueue site already asked. Asking again is not redundancy: a job can sit
  in the queue while the event it names is edited, cancelled, or — the case that
  matters — written onto this very calendar as a mirror by the link pointing the
  other way. Checking only at enqueue time leaves a window in which a job
  enqueued for an ordinary event performs a write for what has since become a
  mirror, which is the loop this feature has to be free of.

  `unique` is keyed on `[:sync_link_id, :source_uid]` — not on the operation —
  and the enqueue site replaces the args of a job that has not started, so an
  upsert followed by a delete for the same event leaves one job carrying the
  delete rather than two racing to decide whether the placeholder survives.

  The uniqueness window is Oban's `:incomplete` group, which includes
  `:executing`, and the replace at the enqueue site names only the states where
  a job has *not* started. That pairing is deliberate, and the reasoning is
  worth keeping because both halves look wrong alone.

  A bare `replace: [:args]` expands across every state — `Oban.Job.put_replace/3`
  maps the fields over `states()` — so it rewrites a running job's args after
  `perform/1` has already read them. The write that arrives is then neither
  deferred nor applied; it is lost. Naming the pending states instead leaves the
  running job alone.

  Dropping `:executing` from uniqueness so the new write becomes its own job
  looks like the better fix and is not: Oban warns that an incomplete window
  missing `:executing` breaks uniqueness, and it is right — two jobs for one
  event could then run concurrently, racing to decide whether the placeholder
  survives, which is the thing uniqueness is here to prevent.

  What remains is a write raised while another is executing being dropped rather
  than deferred. That is a latency cost and not a lasting one:
  `SyncLinkReconcileWorker` re-derives the same decision from the mapping rows
  and the cache, so a delete lost this way is re-enqueued on the next sweep. A
  placeholder outliving its event by one sweep is the accepted trade against two
  writers on one placeholder.

  How long to wait before retrying a failed write.

  Oban's default exhausts all five attempts inside about eighty seconds —
  17s, 20s, 24s, 31s. That is well judged for a dropped connection and
  exactly wrong for the failure this worker actually meets: a provider quota.
  Google meters per user over a rolling minute, so four retries inside ninety
  seconds mostly re-hit the same exhausted window, and a write is discarded
  permanently for a condition that was temporary by definition.

  It is not hypothetical. A backlog of mirrors reached Google at once, every
  job answered "Rate Limit Exceeded", and all of them exhausted their attempts
  and were discarded within the same minute.

  So each retry clears a full quota window and the run spans about twenty
  minutes rather than one. A discarded write is not lost — `SyncLinkReconcile`
  re-derives it from the mapping rows within half an hour — but a placeholder
  that arrives twenty minutes late is better than one that waits for a sweep,
  and far better than a burst of writes that all fail together.
