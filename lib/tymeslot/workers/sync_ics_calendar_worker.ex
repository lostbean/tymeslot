defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SyncIcsCalendarWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker that refreshes a subscribed calendar feed into the local event
  cache.

  A published feed has no delta mechanism: no sync token, no CTag, no
  per-event ETags worth trusting. Every run therefore fetches the whole file
  and replaces the integration's cached events in one transaction
  (`ProviderCalendarEventQueries.full_refresh_for_integration/2`), which is
  also what makes deletions visible — an event that has vanished from the
  feed simply isn't in the replacement set.

  This is the only place the feed URL is fetched. The provider's own read
  path serves this cache, so the freshness of every availability check is
  bounded by how often this worker runs rather than by the publisher's
  response time. See `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Ics.Provider` for why.

  A 401 or 403 means the feed URL has been revoked or rotated, which no
  amount of retrying will fix: the integration is flagged `needs_reauth` and
  the job discarded so the user is prompted to paste a fresh link. Everything
  else records a sync error and retries.
