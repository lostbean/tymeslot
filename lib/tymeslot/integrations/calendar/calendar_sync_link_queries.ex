  Data access for `calendar_sync_links`. All `Repo` calls for the sync-link
  configuration live here (RepoCallBoundary).

  Nothing in this module is user-scoped except `list_for_user/1`, and that one
  filters for the listing rather than for authorisation. A caller reaching
  `get/1`, `update/2` or `delete/1` directly from a LiveView therefore bypasses
  ownership entirely. The check belongs in the context, which — because a link
  names two integrations — has to verify the acting user owns *both* of them,
  not just the one it happens to be editing. `Appearance.with_owned_integration/3`
  is the pattern.

  Reads preload both integrations. The dashboard cannot render a link without
  naming its two ends, and leaving the preload to the caller is how a list view
  ends up issuing one query per row.

  Every enabled link that mirrors *out of* this integration.

  The inbound sync path's question, asked once per synced calendar rather than
  once per event. `enabled` is filtered in SQL rather than by the caller so a
  paused link costs nothing beyond the index scan that skipped it — and, more
  importantly, so that "paused means no writes" is enforced at the one place the
  sync path looks for work rather than at each of the places that act on it.

  No preloads. The caller enqueues jobs keyed on `id`, so loading two
  integrations per link would fetch rows nothing reads, on a path that runs
  after every sync of every calendar.

  Every link naming this integration at either end, enabled or not.

  The teardown question, and deliberately not `list_enabled_for_source/1`'s.
  Disconnecting a calendar has to withdraw the placeholders on it *and* the
  placeholders it caused on other calendars, and a paused link's mirrors are
  still sitting on a provider — pausing leaves them in place by design. So this
  filters on neither direction nor `enabled`: a filter here would be a
  placeholder nobody ever removes.

  Every enabled link whose last reconciliation is older than `max_age_seconds`,
  or which has never been reconciled.

  The reconcile sweep's selection, and deliberately not the same question as
  "every enabled link". A sweep that re-enqueued every link on every run would
  make the cadence of the cron entry the cadence of the work, so a link already
  reconciled a minute ago by a manual trigger or by a previous run that
  overlapped would be re-diffed anyway. Filtering on `last_reconciled_at` makes
  the interval a property of the link rather than of the schedule.

  `nil` sorts as due. A link created between two sweeps has never been
  reconciled and is exactly the one whose mirrors are most likely to be
  missing.

  No preloads: the sweep enqueues jobs keyed on `id` and never looks at either
  integration, so loading two per link would fetch rows nothing reads.
