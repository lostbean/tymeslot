defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Shared.ApiResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared HTTP response handling for the JSON calendar API clients.

  Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph return different error vocabularies, but
  the envelope around them is the same: decode a JSON body on success, treat a
  401 as an expired token, refine a bare 404 using the request path, and fall
  back to a redacted log line plus an opaque message for anything else.

  Centralising that envelope is a safety property rather than a tidiness one.
  The generic fallback is the only place a raw provider body is logged, so it
  is the only place redaction can be forgotten. A provider that handles its own
  statuses inline would have to remember `Redactor.redact_and_truncate/1` every
  time; routing through here means it cannot be skipped.

  Providers keep what genuinely differs, passing it as `:custom`: Google
  classifies a 403 from `error.errors[].reason`, Graph from `error.code` plus a
  `Retry-After` header, and only Graph reports throttling as a bare 429.
