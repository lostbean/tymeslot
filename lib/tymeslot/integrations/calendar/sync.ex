defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Sync do
  @moduledoc """
  Meeting-level reconciliation logic for external calendar changes.

  This module owns change *detection* when a sync worker reports provider
  events that may be linked to Tymeslot meetings. It is provider-agnostic —
  all sync workers (Google, CalDAV, Outlook, etc.) call `reconcile/4` with a
  normalised signal.

  The meeting-side consequences of a detected change (sync-status updates,
  auto-cancellation, host notifications) belong to the Meetings context and
  are delegated to `Tymeslot.Meetings.apply_external_calendar_change/4`.

  Cache writes happen in the sync workers themselves. This module only runs
  when a linked Tymeslot meeting is found.

  Persists a batch of normalised calendar events to the local cache and
  performs downstream side effects.

  Called by every sync worker after its provider-specific `normalise_events/2`
  returns. This is the single point where canonical `CalendarEvent` structs
  become rows in the cache — no sync worker should upsert directly.

  Steps:
  1. Convert each event to cache attrs via `from_calendar_event/1`.
  2. Upsert the batch in a single query.
  3. Invalidate the user's availability cache so subsequent slot lookups
     reflect the newly persisted events.
  4. Broadcast a cache update so live grids refresh.
  5. Reconcile any linked Tymeslot meetings whose times changed externally.

  This function is a convenience wrapper around `upsert_cache/2` and
  `post_commit_reconciliation/2` — callers that need to run the cache
  write inside a `Repo.transaction` alongside other DB work (e.g. the
  CalDAV atomic reconciler) should call those two halves separately.

  Removes externally deleted provider events from the local cache and

  This is the deletion-side counterpart of `persist_normalised_events/2` —
  the single primitive all sync workers use when a provider reports deleted
  events. For each ref:

  1. The cache row is deleted — by `:uid` when present, falling back to
     `:provider_event_id`. Pass `delete_cache: false` when the cache rows
     were already deleted inside an enclosing `Repo.transaction` (e.g. the
     CalDAV atomic reconciler) and only the post-commit reconciliation
     side effects remain.
  2. The linked meeting (if any) is reconciled with `:deleted`. Reconcile
     failures are logged as warnings and do not abort the remaining refs —
     a failed auto-cancellation reverts its own sync status and is retried
     by the next sync run.

  Always returns `:ok`.
