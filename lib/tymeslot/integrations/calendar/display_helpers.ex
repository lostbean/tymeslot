  Names an integration in a way that survives a second account of the same
  provider.

  The `name` column cannot do this alone. Both OAuth helpers store a constant —
  `"Google Calendar"` at `google_oauth_helper.ex`, `"Outlook Calendar"` at
  `outlook_oauth_helper.ex` — and the onboarding wizard stores
  `"CalDAV Calendar"` without ever showing a name field, so an organiser with
  two Google accounts gets two rows that read identically everywhere a name is
  rendered. The account they differ in was already stored at connect time; only
  the display ignored it.

  Composing here rather than writing a better `name` at connect time is
  deliberate. Nothing records whether a name was chosen or generated — a rename
  writes `name` and sets no flag — so a backfill would have to guess, and
  guessing wrong overwrites something a person typed. Composing costs nothing at
  rest, fixes rows already connected, and keeps `name` meaning "what the
  organiser calls this" rather than a derived string that goes stale when an
  account's email changes.

  The qualifier differs by provider family because the families store different
  things:

  - OAuth (Google, Outlook) has `provider_account_email`, which is the account.
  - The CalDAV family has `provider_account_id` as `base_url||username`. Only
    the username is shown: the host is already implied by the provider's own
    name, and the pair is long enough to crowd out the name in a dropdown.
  - An ICS subscription's `provider_account_id` is a SHA-256 digest of the feed
    URL — unique but unreadable — so its origin serves instead. Two feeds from
    one host stay indistinguishable, which is why that form asks for a name.

  A qualifier already present in the name is not repeated, so an organiser who
  renamed a calendar to its own account address does not read it twice.
