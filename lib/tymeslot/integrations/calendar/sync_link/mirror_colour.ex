defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.MirrorColour do
  @moduledoc """
  Paints a placeholder the colour its link asks for, if the target has colours
  to paint with.

  Split out of `SyncLink.Engine` because it is the one part of a mirror write
  that is allowed to fail without the write failing. Everything else there is
  the operation; this is decoration applied after it, with its own rule about
  what a failure means, and keeping the two in one module made that rule easy
  to read as an oversight rather than a decision.

  ## Why it is a second call rather than a field on the payload

  `patch_event_colour/4` lives on `Google.GoogleCalendarApi`. It is not part of
  the shared `Provider` behaviour and cannot be dispatched polymorphically, so
  there is no colour field to put on a payload three provider families share.
  Every other target declines on a function head and no request is made at all.

  The CalDAV family does have a `COLOR` property, and it is still declined: the
  colour-only route patches the event's *cached* `raw_ical`, and a placeholder
  Tymeslot has only just written is not in the target's cache yet, so there
  would be nothing to patch.

  ## Why a failure is swallowed

  Once the placeholder is on the target it blocks the time it exists to block,
  which is the whole feature; the colour is decoration on top. A failure
  propagated here would return an error from the engine, Oban would retry the
  whole mirror, and the retry would re-send the placeholder — provider quota
  and a redundant write — to correct a hue.

  So the patch logs its own failure and returns the write's result untouched.
  The next mirror write for that source repaints, because the patch is
  unconditional rather than diffed against a stored colour: no column records
  what colour the placeholder currently carries, and adding one to save a
  single PATCH would be bookkeeping that can itself drift.

  It runs only after a *successful* write. A failed create has no event to
  paint, and a failed update leaves a placeholder already being retried.

  Paints the placeholder, and answers `result` whatever happens.

  `result` is the outcome of the write this follows, passed through untouched:
  a write that failed has nothing to paint, and a patch that fails must not turn
  a successful write into a failure. `calendar_opts` says which calendar the
  placeholder lives on — without it the PATCH addresses the target's primary
  calendar and 404s on every mirror of a link with a secondary target, silently,
  because a patch failure is swallowed by design.
