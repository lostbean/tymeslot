defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink.Engine do
  @moduledoc """
  Writes one placeholder onto a target calendar and keeps the mapping row that
  records where it went.

  This is the *what*, in the split the codebase uses throughout: the worker owns
  the when — dispatch, retries, backoff, and turning outcomes into Oban's
  vocabulary — while everything here is the domain operation, callable outside a
  job. The return contract is `:ok | {:error, term()} | {:discard, term()}` so
  the worker can pass it straight through, but the meaning of the three is
  decided here, where the reason is known.

  ## Deterministic target UIDs

  A placeholder's UID on the target is derived from `{sync_link_id,
  source_uid}`, never generated randomly. CalDAV's PUT is idempotent on a
  caller-supplied UID, so a write repeated after a lost response converges on
  one event instead of leaving two; and the mapping row, if it is ever lost,
  can be rebuilt by recomputing the UID rather than by guessing which event on
  the target was ours.

  Both halves go into the hash. Without `sync_link_id` two links mirroring the
  same source event onto two calendars would derive the same UID, which is
  harmless while the targets differ and a collision the moment they do not.

  ## Orphan compensation

  The hazard `CalendarEventSync.persist_or_compensate/3` documents applies here
  unchanged. If the provider create succeeds and the mapping insert then fails,
  the placeholder exists on the target with nothing pointing at it. The Oban
  retry finds no mapping, treats the event as unmirrored, and creates a second
  placeholder — and Google and Outlook, which assign event ids server-side,
  cannot detect that they already hold the first. Two busy blocks then sit on
  the target, and only one of them will ever be updated or deleted.

  So a failed persist is followed by a delete of the event just created, before
  the error is surfaced, leaving the retry a clean slate. The compensating
  delete is best-effort: if it also fails, the *original* error is still what
  the caller sees, because that is the failure the retry needs to act on. The
  orphan is then logged at warning, which is the only trace it will leave.

  ## Deleting

  `unmirror/3` is deliberately asymmetric with `mirror/3`. The provider delete
  goes first and the mapping row is dropped only once it succeeds, because the
  row holds the `target_uid` that identifies the placeholder — deleting it first
  would strand a busy block on the organiser's calendar that nothing owns and
  nothing will ever clean up. A delete that fails leaves the row behind in
  `pending_delete`, which is exactly the state the reconcile sweep looks for.

  Every call the link makes — write, delete, colour patch — carries its own
  `target_calendar_id`. A delete falling back to the integration's default
  booking calendar asked the wrong calendar about a placeholder written to a
  secondary one and drew a 404, which was then read as "already gone": the
  mapping row, the only record of where the placeholder was, was dropped and
  the block stranded. A 404 from the right calendar genuinely means gone.

  ## Conflicts, and why they are recorded here

  A mirror is not independently editable: whatever the organiser does to a
  placeholder on the target, the source overwrites it on the next pass, and a
  source deleted while its placeholder was edited takes the placeholder with it.
  Both are defensible resolutions, and both destroy work without saying so —
  which is why each leaves a row in `calendar_sync_conflicts`. The evidence for
  the decision (the etags compared, the timestamps, the provider error) exists
  only inside the branch that made it, so it is recorded there rather than
  reconstructed afterwards from state that has since been overwritten.

  `SyncLink.ConflictLog` owns the classification; this module owns when to ask
  it. The split matters because the same evidence is read on three paths —
  update, delete, and terminal failure — and three independent readings of it is
  how one divergence ends up appended twice under two names.

  ## The mirror colour

  A link may carry a `mirror_colour` so the organiser can see at a glance which
  calendar a busy block came from. It is applied by `SyncLink.MirrorColour`
  after the placeholder is written, and deliberately cannot fail the write —
  see that module for why a patch swallows its own failure.

  ## The attempt count

  `write_failed` is the one conflict that turns on something the domain cannot
  see: whether Oban will try again. A retryable error is a write still in
  flight, not a resolution, and recording each attempt would fill the history
  with rows for writes that succeeded seconds later. So the caller passes its
  attempt number — exactly as `Meetings.CalendarEventSync` takes one, for the
  same purpose — and only the final attempt records a failure.

  # `create_event/2` promises `{:ok, map()}`, but not one shape of map: the
  # CalDAV family answers with the payload it PUT (carrying the UID the caller
  # supplied), while Google and Outlook echo the provider's own response, whose
  # id is server-assigned and lives under `"id"`. `nil` is an acceptable answer
  # — the mapping is still written, keyed on the deterministic `target_uid`,
  # which is what every subsequent update and delete addresses. The provider id
  # is recorded for diagnosis and for the reconcile sweep, not for addressing.
