  Data access for `calendar_sync_mirrors`. All `Repo` calls for the mirror
  mappings live here (RepoCallBoundary).

  Two readers, pulling in opposite directions:

  `get_by_link_and_source_uid/2` is the engine's forward lookup — from a link
  and the source event it is processing to the placeholder already written, or
  nothing. It rides the unique index on `[sync_link_id, source_uid]`.

  `mirror_uids_for_integrations/1` is the calendar grid's backward lookup —
  from the integrations whose events it is about to draw to the UIDs among them
  that are mirrors and must be hidden. It rides
  `calendar_sync_mirrors_target_uid_index` on
  `[target_integration_id, target_uid]`, which exists solely for this question:
  without it the grid falls to a sequential scan of every mirror row in the
  installation, on every render, and the grid re-renders on navigation, on live
  cache updates, and on every appearance change.

  The backward lookup returns a `MapSet` rather than a list because its caller
  is a per-event membership test inside a render loop. Handing back a list
  would turn one filter pass into a scan per event.

  Every mirror living on the given target integrations, as a set of
  `{integration_id, target_uid}` pairs.

  Measured at 100,000 mirror rows across 20 target integrations, selecting
  five of them: a Bitmap Index Scan on
  `[target_integration_id, target_uid]` feeding a Bitmap Heap Scan, ~4.9 ms.
  Not an index-only scan — the visibility map on a table this write-heavy is
  rarely all-visible, so the heap is still read — but the index is what keeps
  the row count proportional to the integrations asked for rather than to
  every mirror in the installation.

  `pending_delete` mirrors are included deliberately. Their placeholder is
  still on the provider until it confirms the delete, so it is still in the
  event cache and still needs hiding; dropping it from this set would make the
  mirror flash into the organiser's grid for exactly as long as the teardown
  takes.

  # Every identity a placeholder can be cached under, because the two provider

  # The CalDAV family stores the UID it is handed, so `target_uid` comes back
  # unchanged. Google does not: a create sends `id`, and Google answers with an
  # iCalUID of its own making — `{id}@google.com` — which is what the next
  # inbound sync caches. The UID we asked for is then nowhere in the cache, and
  # a set built only from `target_uid` recognises none of our own placeholders.
  #
  # That is not a theoretical gap. Every one of 317 cached placeholders on a
  # live installation was unrecognisable this way, which disabled loop
  # prevention completely: each placeholder read as an ordinary event, was
  # mirrored back across the link, and one real event accumulated a second and
  # third "Busy" on the calendar it started on.
  #
  # A mirror whose write never landed has no provider id, and `nil` is dropped
  # rather than added — a set containing it would match every cached event
  # whose uid is also absent.
  #
  # The stored provider id is Google's bare event id, because that is what the
  # write answered with: `convert_event/1` reads the response's `"id"`. The
  # *cache* is filled by the normaliser, which prefers `"iCalUID"` — the same
  # id with `@google.com` appended. So the id as recorded never equals the uid
  # as cached, and the suffixed form has to be in the set too or the row still
  # recognises nothing. Adding the variant here rather than at the write keeps
  # every mapping already in the database working, including the ones written

  The first step of tearing a link down, and it runs *before* the provider is

  reconcile sweep looks for, so the teardown resumes rather than stalling with
  rows that still claim to be `active`.

  One `UPDATE` rather than a row at a time: a link with a year of history can
  hold thousands of mappings, and the transition carries no per-row decision.
