defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.SyncLink do
  @moduledoc """
  The organiser's cross-calendar mirroring configuration: which calendar's
  events get a placeholder written onto which other calendar, and under what
  privacy tier.

  A focused sibling of `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar` in the shape
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Appearance` established: the context owns
  connecting and syncing calendars, and this owns the relationships configured
  between the ones already connected.

  ## Why authorisation lives here and nowhere else

  `CalendarSyncLinkQueries` is not user-scoped. `get/1`, `update/2` and
  `delete/1` take an id and act on whatever row carries it, so a LiveView
  reaching for a query module directly hands the browser a way to edit another
  organiser's links by guessing an integer. Every write on this module
  therefore takes the acting user's id and verifies ownership before touching a
  row, answering `{:error, :not_found}` — not `:forbidden` — so a forged id
  cannot be used to probe which ids exist.

  A sync link is harder to guard than an appearance row, because it names
  *two* integrations. Both are forgeable and both are checked: naming a
  stranger's calendar as either end fails, and the check runs before the
  changeset so no row is written and no error message reveals anything about
  the calendar named. `owned_by?/2` rather than `get_for_user/2`, following
  `Appearance.with_owned_integration/3`: the latter decrypts credentials and
  can answer `:requires_reencryption`, neither of which has any bearing on
  whether a link may be configured.

  ## Why the context loads the target integration

  Two changeset rules — a read-only subscription can never be a mirror target,
  and the CalDAV family ignores a calendar id on write — depend on the target's
  provider, which a changeset cannot look up. `CalendarSyncLinkSchema` takes it
  as the virtual `:target_provider` field and, crucially, *skips both rules*
  when it is absent rather than failing. A caller that forgets it gets a link
  pointing at an ICS feed that will fail on every mirror write forever. This
  module is the one place that guarantees it is supplied: the ownership check
  already loads the target integration, so the provider is in hand and there is
  no second query to pay for.

  Saves a whole grid of source→target cells at once.

  The link matrix presents every ordered pair of the organiser's calendars
  together, so a save is a diff against what is already configured rather than
  a series of creates: cells newly ticked become links, cells cleared become
  deletions, and — the rule the rest of this function exists to protect — cells
  that did not move are not touched at all.

  That last one is not an optimisation. Recreating an unchanged link means
  deleting it first, and `delete_link/2` withdraws every placeholder it has
  written from the provider on its way out. A save that rebuilt the whole grid
  would therefore tear down and rewrite every mirror in the set, turning a
  no-op into a burst of provider writes and leaving the organiser's other
  calendars briefly empty of the busy blocks that are the entire point.

  ## Why this is not a transaction

  Every cell is validated before any cell is written, so an invalid pair
  rejects the save whole rather than applying half of it. That check could not
  be a `Repo.transaction` even if it were convenient: deletion runs
  `Teardown.tear_down_link/2`, which deletes placeholders from Google, Outlook
  or a CalDAV server, and holding a database transaction open across those
  calls would tie up a pool connection for the length of a provider's
  latency — the failure the sync path is carefully built to avoid.

  Validation covers what the caller can forge: both ends of every pair must
  belong to the acting user, and no cell may name one calendar twice. What it
  cannot pre-empt is a provider refusing a withdrawal mid-save; a partial
  result is reported honestly rather than rolled back, because the placeholders
  already removed cannot be restored by a database rollback.

  Cells are `{source_integration_id, target_integration_id}` tuples. Anything
  already linked but absent from the list is deleted, which is what makes
  clearing a row of the grid work.

  Edits an existing link.

  The target may move, so ownership is re-verified against the target the
  attributes ask for rather than the one already stored, and the provider
  handed to the changeset is that new target's.

  ## Why an edit can withdraw placeholders

  Re-pointing a link is `delete_link/2`'s hazard reached by another route. The
  placeholders are on the calendar the link *used to* name, and the mapping
  rows go on pointing at them while the link points somewhere else — so nothing
  will ever remove them, and a busy block is deliberately indistinguishable
  from an ordinary one, so the organiser will not know what it is. An edit that
  invalidates the mappings therefore withdraws them first, through the same
  `SyncLink.Teardown` that link removal uses. `SyncLink.TargetMove` decides
  which edits those are.

  ## The order, and what a failure leaves behind

  Teardown reads the link *as it stands*, so it must run before the row is
  written — a withdrawal aimed at the new target would ask a calendar that
  never held the placeholders, draw a 404 that reads as "already gone", and
  drop the only rows naming them. And it must succeed before the row is
  written: a failed withdrawal followed by a successful re-point is exactly the
  orphan this exists to prevent, arrived at with the evidence destroyed.

  So a provider that refuses the delete surfaces its own reason — the same
  `{:error, term()}` `delete_link/2` answers with — and the link keeps its old
  target untouched. The organiser's edit did not happen and they are told so;
  the mappings are left in `pending_delete`, which is the state the reconcile
  sweep retries, so the withdrawal finishes on its own and the edit can be
  saved again.

  Validation comes before all of it. An invalid changeset — a target that is a
  read-only subscription, say — returns the changeset and withdraws nothing:
  the link is not moving, so its placeholders are still exactly where the
  mappings say they are, and emptying the target for a save that was refused
  would be destruction in exchange for nothing.

  ## What refills the new target

  Nothing here. A successful teardown drops the mapping rows, so the link
  starts empty, and `Workers.SyncLinkReconcileWorker` enqueues an `:upsert` for
  every eligible source event it finds without one — which, with no mappings
  left, is all of them. That is why `enabled` is restored below: teardown
  pauses the link on its way through, and
  `CalendarSyncLinkQueries.list_due_for_reconcile/1` skips a disabled link
  holding no `pending_delete` rows, so a move that left it paused would leave
  the new target permanently empty. Restoring the *stored* value rather than
  forcing `true` keeps a deliberately paused link paused.

  The refill therefore arrives on the next sweep rather than immediately. No
  job is enqueued for a move.

  ## Why an edit can rewrite placeholders instead

  The edits that are not moves divide again. A tier, a label or a colour leaves
  every placeholder where it is and changes what it *says*, and nothing else in
  the system notices: the push path fires on a source event changing, and the
  reconcile sweep compares the source's timestamp against the mapping's, so a
  link switched to `generic_label` kept saying "Busy" until somebody happened
  to edit the source. `SyncLink.Remirror` decides which edits those are and
  enqueues an `:upsert` per mapping, each rebuilding its payload from the link
  as saved.

  Only one of the two ever runs. A save that both re-points and re-labels tears
  the mappings down, which leaves nothing to rewrite — see `apply_edit/3`.

  Removes a link, withdrawing every placeholder it wrote before the row that

  The order is not an optimisation, it is the whole operation.
  `on_delete: :delete_all` takes the mapping rows with the link, and those rows

  deleting the link first leaves busy blocks on the organiser's other calendar
  that nothing owns and nothing will ever remove. `SyncLink.Teardown` documents

  A placeholder that cannot be withdrawn therefore *keeps the link*. The link
