  The most recent conflict of one kind for one source on one link.

  Exists for the kinds whose condition *persists* rather than describing a
  moment — `occurrence_moved`, today. A moved occurrence stays moved: the
  placeholder goes on expanding it at its original time until the organiser
  moves it back or correction is built, so every sync of that calendar sees the
  same divergence again. Without this the log would gain a row per sync for a
  finding the organiser was told about once, and its row count — which is the
  measure the kind exists to produce — would read as a frequency it is not.

  `{:error, :not_found}` means nothing of that kind has been recorded for this
  source, which the caller reads as "report it".

  Scoped to `source_uid` as well as the link, because the question is always
  about one event's history: another series' moves say nothing about this one's.

  One link's conflict history, newest first.

  Ordered and capped rather than returned whole: the dashboard shows a recent
  window, and an append-only table under a busy link has no upper bound worth
  loading into a socket assign. `:limit` overrides the default of
  #{@default_limit}.

  Ties on `occurred_at` break by id descending. A sweep recording several
  divergences in one pass can stamp them with the same instant, and without the
  tiebreak their order would be whatever the planner chose that run — so the
  list would reshuffle between two renders of unchanged data.

  The recent history of several links at once, keyed by link id and newest
  first within each.

  The dashboard's read. One query for every link on the page rather than one per
  link: the panel renders an organiser's links together, and asking per row is
  the n+1 the link queries' preloads already exist to avoid.

  The cap is per link and applied in SQL, by numbering each link's rows in a
  window partitioned on `sync_link_id` and keeping the first `limit` of each.
  A plain `LIMIT` would be the wrong shape: it caps the result overall, so one
  busy link could fill the whole allowance and leave a quieter one's section
  blank on a dashboard that has divergences to show it.

  The window is what the cap has to be, not merely a faster way to reach the
  same answer. Narrowing to one organiser's links bounds nothing — retention
  keeps 90 days, and grouping in Elixir after an unbounded `Repo.all()` loads
  and sorts every one of those rows on every dashboard render to then discard
  all but a handful per link.

  Links with no history are absent rather than present with an empty list, so a
  caller can render a section for exactly the keys it finds.

  Drops conflicts older than `days`, in bounded batches.

  Cut on `occurred_at`, not `inserted_at`. A reconciliation sweep discovers a
  divergence some time after it happened and stamps the real time, so the two
  columns can be months apart — and pruning on insertion would keep a
  year-old conflict alive for a further retention window purely because a sweep
  was late to notice it. `occurred_at` is also what the index and the dashboard
  order by, so the retention cut matches the window an organiser can actually
  see.

  A zero, negative, or non-integer window deletes nothing. The audit exists to
  outlive the state that produced it, and a misconfigured retention that silently
  emptied it would destroy the only record of every resolution ever made.
